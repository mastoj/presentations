<Notes>
Since the above might not be the area of expertise that you specialize in, pairing up with one or more people might be a good idea. Preferably someone that complements you and also can help challenge what you want to do to check if it even make sense. In my specific scenario I got help from three people I would say. Two other developers so we could make a really rough proof of concept and one more person to help create a solid business case. This was crucial for me to be able to drive the change I wanted to make.

It also helps a lot to have both someone to discuss with, but more importantly, having a couple of first people believe in what you want to do will make all the difference. If you can't get anyone to believe in what you want to do, it will be very hard to drive change in any organization. Getting that first follower is very important, and also fun.
