<Notes>

- Next, let's look at how our architecture evolved during the project.
- First we had a large kubernetes cluster running everything.
- Initially we moved the ecom site to vercel using nextjs, but kept the CDN
- Later we moved the CDN to vercel as well
- Might seem more complex, but trust me, it is not. The operation in Vercel is close to 0
