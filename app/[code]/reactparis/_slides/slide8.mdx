Be prepared that you will get the argument that timing is bad. In most cases I agree 100%, the problem is that timing will always be bad. Most of the time the time when this would have been right was yesterday, and unfortunately we can't travel back in time. So the second best option is most likely now. If you have a good business case, it is most likely worth a shot.
