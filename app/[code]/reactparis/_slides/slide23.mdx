<Notes>
This should not be a surprise, but the more network jumps you have, the more time it takes to load your page. When we first went live we had another CDN acting as a proxy in front of Vercel. I would say this was something we actually needed to have to make a gradual migration, but it was also a bottleneck. We had to remove it as soon as possible to improve the performance of the site. The removal was something that happend in the first week of January this year and we saw an improvement in site performance right away, and most of the improvements was due to lower time to first byte.
