Not sure how many of you that have visited any of our sites in the Nordics or even know the size of the site. Elkjøp is the largest electronics retailer in the Nordics and we have a lot of traffic. When I joined elkjøp we had a site that looked a lot of the time like image you see here on the left. Dynamically loading content could of course be ok, if they stream in within a reasonable time... but that was not the case. I mean, it should not be enough time to make a screenshot if you ask me. In this particular case we had reports that it took 30 seconds or more for the prices to load. I don't know about you, but I don't have that long patience and would leave any site with this kind of experience... unless I knew there were some really amazing offers, and that is what saves us a lot of the time :)


This experience also lead to some comments online, like the ones below the image from reddit. The first one is translated to something like "The site is horrible, so I end up on another site". The second one is from a person working in one of our stores and they are also frustrated. These are just two examples of many comments online the last couple of years. As a developer it sort of hurts seeing this kind of feedback, even though I was not part of the team delivering the previous version, so that is something I wanted to address. I even had a fellow speaker here at the conference asked me when I joined elkjøp when I will fix the site. So this is partly the story of how we made it from what you see on the left to what we have one the right hand side. The score on the right is from Vercel's speed insights and we also have the Google's page speed insights, and this score has been consistent since we went live.
